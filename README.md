Description:
            Assistant Smith is a side project to automate Anarchy Online Game Play. This program doesnt require any scripting or configuring really.
            
# How-To:
1-Load your anarchy online accounts
2-Select your main char from the drop down window 
3-Click Set
4-On your Accounts Bind All of your attacks and perks on all toons to the F key
5-On all of your sub (Not your main) add a '/assist ASS /assist<MainToonName>' to your hot bar
6-For AFK mode click RUN
7-For Multibox Support, check the On button, switch to Off to disable.
  (NOTE: Currently switching from Multibox mode to AFK mode causes a crash of the client and program, will fix this tomorrow

  -Close the window and reload the program for now until I fix it.
# TODO:
